# Patterns to Avoid

<!--
HOW TO USE THIS FILE
This file captures everything that makes your writing sound like it wasn't written by you: phrases you'd never say, structural patterns that feel generic, tone signals that are off.

Start by reviewing the pre-populated sections below — keep what applies to you, remove what doesn't, and add your own. Then build this file over time as you use the system. The End of Session step in system-prompt.md is specifically designed to help you catch patterns worth adding.

The goal is to document them once here rather than catch them every time mid-session.

## Punctuation

<!--
Specific punctuation rules that define your style. Pre-populate with anything non-negotiable for you.
-->

- [e.g. "No em dashes used as separators mid-sentence. This includes — and – and --. If tempted to use one, split into two sentences instead."]
- [Add your own punctuation preferences here]

## AI-Sounding Filler Phrases

<!--
These phrases add length without meaning. The list below contains common AI defaults worth cutting regardless of your voice.
Keep the ones that apply to you, remove the ones that don't, and add any you keep catching in your own drafts.
-->

These add length without meaning. Cut or rewrite them.

- "It's worth noting that..."
- "In today's landscape..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "This is a reminder that..."
- "Let's dive in."
- "Excited to share..."
- "Thrilled to announce..."
- "Game-changer" / "game-changing"
- "Unlock" used metaphorically (e.g. "unlock your potential")
- "Leverage" when "use" works fine
- "Delve into"
- "Groundbreaking"
- "Innovative solution"
- [Add phrases you keep catching and deleting from your own drafts]

## Structural Patterns

<!--
Patterns in how content is constructed that feel generic or AI-generated when you see them.
Fill in with the structural habits you want flagged. Think about how posts in your field tend to be written and what makes yours different.
-->

- [Opening patterns to avoid: e.g. "Starting a post with a broad universal statement ('Leadership is hard.' / 'We live in uncertain times.')"]
- [Formatting defaults: e.g. "Bullet lists that should be prose"]
- [Closing patterns: e.g. "Ending with a hollow question ('What do you think? Drop a comment below.')"]
- [Summary patterns: e.g. "Restating the opening point at the end as a 'takeaway'"]
- [Voice patterns: e.g. "Passive voice where active voice is cleaner ('It was decided' vs. 'We decided')"]

---

## Tone Red Flags

<!--
Things that signal your writing has drifted away from your actual voice. These are usually harder to spot than phrase-level patterns — they show up in the overall feel of a draft.
-->

- [Register flags: e.g. "Overly formal register that doesn't sound like you speaking"]
- [Authenticity flags: e.g. "Humblebragging framed as a lesson"]
- [Specificity flags: e.g. "Vague impact claims without specifics ('drove significant results', 'made a big difference')"]
- [Add your own tone signals here]

---

## Yellow Flags (sometimes okay — call it out and ask before finalizing)

<!--
Patterns worth flagging but not automatically removing. The model should surface these and ask before cutting.
-->
