HOW TO USE THIS FILE
This file tracks what you've published, what's coming up, and how things performed. It serves two purposes:

1. It gives the model context on what you've already covered so you don't accidentally repeat yourself
2. It shows which topics and angles are resonating with your audience, which the model uses to inform new ideation

You don't need to backfill everything at once. Starting from today and logging forward is enough. Add historical posts if you want the model to have more context early on.

FILL IN THE CONFIGURATION SECTION FIRST, then start logging content entries below.
