# Writing System Template

A personal writing system for working with AI on content that sounds like you, not like AI. Built around six files that load at the start of every session to give the model the context it needs.

***step by step instructions included at the end, if you need them***

## Files in This System

**system-prompt.md** — The startup file. Paste this into your AI tool's system prompt or project instructions. It tells the assistant what to read, how to approach each session, and how to close.

**voice-rules.md** — Your voice document. Covers tone, format, and the non-negotiables for how you write. The more specific this is, the better the output.

**avoid-patterns.md** — Everything that makes your writing sound like it wasn't written by you: phrases, structures, tone signals. Grows over time as you notice patterns.

**writing-samples.md** — Existing writing you're happy with. The model reads these to calibrate to your actual voice, not the average.

**content-calendar.md** — Tracks what you've published, what's coming, and how things performed. Prevents repetition and helps build future content from what's resonating.

**drafts.md** — Holding space for posts in development. Move to content-calendar.md once finalized.

## How to Get Started

You don't need everything filled in before your first session. Start with these two and build from there:

1. **writing-samples.md** — Add 3 to 6 pieces of writing you're proud of. This is the highest-leverage file. It gives the model an actual target instead of an approximation.
2. **voice-rules.md** — Fill in your voice, tone, and format rules. The more specific the better. "Conversational" is not an instruction. "Write like a smart colleague talking to another smart colleague, not like a consultant writing a report" is.

After that:

3. Fill in **system-prompt.md** — replace the [PLACEHOLDER] fields with your name, platform, and any workflow preferences.
4. Build out **avoid-patterns.md** as you use the system. The End of Session step is specifically designed to help you catch patterns worth adding.
5. Log past content in **content-calendar.md** if you want the model to have historical context from day one. Otherwise, start fresh and log as you go.

## How the System Grows

This is not a one-time setup. Every session is an opportunity to refine it. The End of Session step in system-prompt.md asks: based on what happened today, should anything be added to voice-rules.md or avoid-patterns.md? The system gets better as you use it.
