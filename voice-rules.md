# Voice Rules

<!--
HOW TO USE THIS FILE
Fill in each section with rules specific to how you actually write. Be specific — "conversational" is a starting point, but something like "write like a smart colleague talking to another smart colleague, not like a consultant writing a report" is an instruction the model can act on.

Aim for rules that would help a stranger write in your voice, not just describe your writing to someone who's already read it.

This file is read at the start of every writing session. Keep it honest to how you actually write, not how you aspire to write. Aspirational rules produce aspirational outputs. Accurate rules produce outputs that sound like you.

## Voice and Tone

<!--
How do you sound? What register do you write in? What is your writing NOT?
Fill in the blanks below with your own rules. The prompts are a starting point — rewrite, remove, or add as needed.
-->

- [Overall register: e.g. "Conversational but professional. Write like a smart colleague talking to another smart colleague, not like a consultant writing a report."]
- [Confidence and hedging: e.g. "Confident without being arrogant. State things directly. Avoid hedging phrases like 'it's worth noting that' or 'one might argue.'"]
- [Authenticity standard: e.g. "Human first. If a sentence sounds like it was written by AI, rewrite it."]

## [PLATFORM] Writing Principles

<!--
Replace [PLATFORM] with where you primarily publish: LinkedIn, Substack, your blog, internal docs, etc.
Add the specific rules that apply to that format. If you write for multiple platforms, duplicate this section.
-->

- [How do you open? e.g. "Lead with a specific insight, observation, or moment — not a generic setup or broad statement."]
- [Paragraph length? e.g. "Short paragraphs. One to two sentences max."]
- [What hooks or opener formulas do you avoid? e.g. "Avoid hook formulas like 'Unpopular opinion:' or 'Here's what nobody tells you about...'"]
- [How do you close? What do you avoid? e.g. "Don't wrap up with a call to action unless it's genuinely useful. 'What do you think?' as a closer is lazy."]
- [What do you value most in your writing? e.g. "Real over polished. A slightly rough honest take beats a smooth generic one."]

## General Rules

<!--
Rules that apply regardless of platform or format.
-->

- [Active vs. passive voice: e.g. "Write in active voice."]
- [Language complexity: e.g. "Use plain language. If a simpler word works, use it."]
- [How you use data: e.g. "Numbers and data should support a point, not replace one."]
- [Conclusions: e.g. "Avoid ending on a summary that just restates what you already said."]

---

## Format Preferences

<!--
Specific, non-negotiable formatting rules. These are especially useful for catching formatting habits the model defaults to.
-->

- [Prose vs. bullets: e.g. "Prose over bullets where possible."]
- [Sentence structure: e.g. "Short sentences over long compound ones."]
- [Punctuation rules: e.g. "No em dashes. If tempted to use one, split into two sentences instead."]
- [Any other structural preferences you hold firmly]
