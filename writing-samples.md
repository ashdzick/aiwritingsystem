# Writing Samples

<!--
HOW TO USE THIS FILE
This is the most important calibration file. The model reads these samples to understand what your writing actually looks like — not what you've described, but what you've produced.

Without samples, the model defaults to the average of everything it's been trained on. That average has a recognizable voice. It's not yours.

HOW MANY TO INCLUDE
Aim for 3 to 6 samples to start. Add more over time. The system improves as the sample set grows.

WHAT TO INCLUDE
Prioritize range over volume. A single long sample is less useful than three samples from different formats, topics, or registers.

Good samples to include:
- A piece you're proud of that represents your best work
- Something short that captures your everyday voice
- Something longer that shows how you structure an argument over time
- Something from a format or context you write in often

WHAT TO WRITE IN THE NOTE FIELD
The note below each sample title matters. It tells the model what to take from this specific example — what it demonstrates, why you included it, what makes it representative. "This is a good post" is not a useful note. "This represents my everyday register — direct, specific, and grounded in a real observation rather than a broad statement" gives the model something to calibrate from.

## Sample 1: [FORMAT / TOPIC]

<!--
Example label: "Short post / Career advice"
Note: What does this sample demonstrate? What should the model take from it?
e.g. "This represents my everyday voice. It's direct, observation-led, and shows how I open with something specific rather than a broad category statement."

Add more samples here as you find writing you're happy with.
The more range you include — short and long, different topics, different contexts — the better the model can calibrate.
