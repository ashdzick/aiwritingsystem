# Drafts in Progress

<!--
HOW TO USE THIS FILE
This is a holding space for posts in development — things that are being worked on but aren't ready to publish or schedule yet.

Use it to capture:
- Work in progress with notes on what's unresolved
- Ideas that have a clear angle but no draft yet
- Posts that were drafted but need another pass before finalizing

Move a post to content-calendar.md once it's finalized and scheduled.
-->

Posts that are being developed but not yet scheduled. Add to content-calendar.md once finalized.

**Topic:** [Which content pillar does this fit? Or note the specific topic area.]
**Note:** [What's unresolved? What does this draft need before it's ready? Be specific — e.g. "Strong story but the ending feels moralistic. Needs a rewrite of the last two paragraphs." Or: "Rough idea only — needs a real angle before drafting."]
